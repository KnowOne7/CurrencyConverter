# Currency Converter

https://favtutor.com/blogs/cpp-projects-for-beginners
One of the best ways to revise basic concepts is to build a basic project, and there’s nothing easier than a converter. All you have to do is take input of the currency required and display the output accordingly. There also needs to be a way to customize the currencies from some sort of menu or dropdown. Data for the conversion can be fetched from an external file, or simply stored as a separate module.

A converter should have some validation to ensure that the conversion works only on numeric data. An error should be displayed for invalid data accordingly.

One addition that the project demands is in the value of the currency for conversion. A static file or module would mean that the currency values don’t manually change with time. Fetching data for updating these values from the Internet will not only give a more accurate result, but it will also help one build their networking concepts and build a better project (overall).
